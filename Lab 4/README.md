# Ph-UI!!!

For lab this week, we focus on both on sensing, to bring in new modes of input into your devices, as well as prototyping the physical look and feel of the device. You will think about the physical form the device needs to perform the sensing as well as present the display or feedback about what was sensed. 


### Start brasinstorming ideas by reading: 
* [What do prototypes prototype?](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/What-do-Prototypes-Prototype-Houde-Hill/30bc6125fab9d9b2d5854223aeea7900a218f149)
* [Paper prototyping](https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/paper-prototyping-the-practical-beginners-guide/) is used by UX designers to quickly develop interface ideas and run them by people before any programming occurs. 
* [Cardboard prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_9Q-KDSb9o) help interactive product designers to work through additional issues, like how big something should be, how it could be carried, where it would sit. 
* [Tips to Cut, Fold, Mold and Papier-Mache Cardboard](https://makezine.com/2016/04/21/working-with-cardboard-tips-cut-fold-mold-papier-mache/) from Make Magazine.
* [Surprisingly complicated forms](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/50032245843343100/) can be built with paper, cardstock or cardboard.  The most advanced and challenging prototypes to prototype with paper are [cardboard mechanisms](https://www.pinterest.com/helgangchin/paper-mechanisms/) which move and change.

### Part C
### Physical considerations for sensing

Usually, sensors need to positioned in specific locations or orientations to make them useful for their application. Now that you've tried a bunch of the sensors, pick one that you would like to use, and an application where you use the output of that sensor for an interaction. For example, you can use a distance sensor to measure someone's height if you position it overhead and get them to stand under it.

**\*\*\*Draw 5 sketches of different ways you might use your sensor, and how the larger device needs to be shaped in order to make the sensor useful.\*\*\***

![sketches p3](https://github.com/nicholasburka/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%204/sketches-p2.png)

**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***
- How will I route wiring through the body of these devices?
- Will I hold the Pi inside the main device chamber, or in a separate container?
- What will the most satisfying proportions of the device be for use?
- Will the device be touchable without it being moved? How could I prevent this?

**\*\*\*Pick one of these designs to prototype.\*\*\***

### Part D
### Physical considerations for displaying information and housing parts

 
**\*\*\*Sketch 5 designs for how you would physically position your display and any buttons or knobs needed to interact with it.\*\*\***
![sketches part D](https://github.com/nicholasburka/Interactive-Lab-Hub/blob/Fall2021/Lab%204/display-sketches.png)
**\*\*\*What are some things these sketches raise as questions? What do you need to physically prototype to understand how to anwer those questions?\*\*\***
- wire management
- keeping the copper tape neat
- wiring between the cap sensor, pi, and LED stick
- sturdy/usable base
- viability of moving displays, how to ground these well
- how big does text need to be to be readable while using the device

**\*\*\*Explain the rationale for the design. (my answer written below)\*\*\*** (e.g. Does it need to be a certain size or form or need to be able to be seen from a certain distance?)
Design rationale: most information condensed into the use of the LED's. While the 1st + 2nd design may be more versatile for types of rhythms, I like the ability of the user to see where the current beat lies within the measure. It's also simple.

**\*\*\*Document your rough prototype.\*\*\***

LAB PART 2

### Part 2

Following exploration and reflection from Part 1, complete the "looks like," "works like" and "acts like" prototypes for your design, reiterated below.
### Part F
### Record

[Rhythm-a-Thing Soundcheck](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6mtE1do4bNI)
- Playing the rhythm-a-thing

[Rhythm-a-Thing Display Movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqioQe3bVVo)
- Not fully functional prototype, but lights move in time. Covered with back of copper tape because LED's are too bright for camera.

Document all the prototypes and iterations you have designed and worked on! Again, deliverables for this lab are writings, sketches, photos, and videos that show what your prototype:
* "Looks like": shows how the device should look, feel, sit, weigh, etc.
* "Works like": shows what the device can do
* "Acts like": shows how a person would interact with the devic
